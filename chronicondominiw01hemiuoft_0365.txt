APPENDIX.

THE following Appendix contains a summary of the
differences between the copies preserved by Heming-
burgh, and those printed from the original exemplars in
the body of this work, os the Magna Charta and Charta
de Foresta by Henry ΙΙΙ. in 1225, the Confirmation of
these Charters in 1237 by the same king, and the sen-
tence of Excommunication denounced against those who
should violate them, in 1253. The general reasons which
led to the adoption of this plan having been stated in
the Preface, it is needless to recapitulate them here.
An additional cause, however, not there mentioned, jus-
tifies the measure, as far as regards this Chronicle, in a
more particular way; viz. that Hemingburgh had given
the great charters of English liberty of 1225, with the
preamble of those granted by Henry III. in the first year
of his reign, by advice of Gualo the papal legate, the
Earl of Pembroke, and other nobles, thus consounding
the two sets of charters together3 a species of inaccu-
racy, as Sir W. Blackstone remarks, very frequent in
the monkish historians, or the registers of those abbeys
from whence they drew their materials.
