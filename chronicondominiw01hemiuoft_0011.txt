PREFACE.

T will naturally be expected byH Na ³¹¹¹? os
the historical enquirer that the bur υτεῐιῐῖ ε’
ᾗ first portion of this Preface
should contain an explanation

of the change made in the name

of an Author so well-known

and much esteemed as Walter
Hemingford. A considerable space will there-

fore be devoted to the disquisition of this critical
point, which will, it is hoped, prove satisfactorily

that nothing but the love of truth has induced me

to inscribe the name of Hemingburgh on one of

the choicest histories of the commencement of

the fourteenth century.

The following, and most authentic record
which we possess, of our Author's name is pre-
served in a copy of his Chronicle‚ written on
vellum, about the year 1350 :—“ Expliciunt tres
libri compilati a domino Waltero Hemingburght
canonico de Gysebur5‚ de gestis Anglorum ab
adventu Willelmi Bastardi Conquaestoris usque

 

ad mortem strenuissimi regis Edwardi primi
post conquaestum.'’ ¹ This is corroborated by an
cntry in a course of Sermons for the ecclesias-
tical year, MS. Reg. 3 A. xiii. British Museum,

¹ MS. Lansdown 2³9, folio 120 b. at the end of the third book.
