where, after the table of Contents, and before
the first sermon, we find the following rubrio:
—“ The Book of St. Mary's‚ Gisborough, pre·
sented to the cabinet of the cloister3 the gift of
friar Walter de Hemingburgh, formerly Canon
of the said house, viz. A.D. 130’7.”1 ’ As the
Priory Church was destroyed by fire in May
1289, with many and valuable books of theology,
chalices‚ vestments, etc„ it is likely that such a
gift would be the more acceptable. The rubrio,
although at first sight it might lead us to assign
the death of Hemingburgh to 1307, bears inter-
nal evidence of having been written at a period
considerably Subsequent to the work itself, and
therefore we must not attach much importance to
the quondm,- the ’date probably refers to the time
of the donation.

By Leland, on whom as an accurate and labo-
rious antiquary much reliance may be placed,
Walter Hemingburgh is thus mentioned ε “Gual-
terius Hemengoburgus, a canon of the Priory
of Gisborough, near Clive, a small district in
Yorkshiref adjacent to the famous river Tees,
was much attached to the study of letters; by
which eventually it followed that he became
a learned man, and gained for himself no small
credit with his contemporaries. For literature
is such a recommendation, that it readily obtains

for its possessor favour, honour, and even glory.
