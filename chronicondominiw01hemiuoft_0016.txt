x PREFAGE.

burgus into Hemmyngforde admits of no elucida-
tion; nor does it appear that the family of Hem-
ingford had ever any transaction with the Priory
of Gisborough.¹ The entry in the Abingdon
Chronicle, in the Public Library at Cambridge,
Dd. ii. 5, is but a repetition from Bale‚ as the
words “ provinciolam Thesi flumini adjacentem,”
and indeed the whole entry, plainly shew. It
thus appears that Bale, in the year 1549, or his
contemporary, Horman, was the first to pervert
our author's name, which error has been in-
advertently followed by others. Tanner and
Hearne, however, were aware of the mistake.
Every circumstance would lead us to conclude
that Walter de Hemingburgh was born of an in-
fluential family² in the neighbourhood of Hem-
ingborough‚ in the wapentake os Ouse and Der-
went, in the East Riding of York, and at some
distance from the Priory of Gisborough in the
North Riding, once the principa] cemetery sor
the nobility of the surrounding country. Thither‘
he was sent for his education, as was the custom
in early times, where, by the attention of the
pious monks, his taste sor learning and the study
of theology was successfully cultivated, and
where the beauty of the rich and fertile vale, and
the romantio hill country that surrounds the
Priory, lent their aid to form and elevate the
mind of the student, and offered a free scope for
quiet and undisturbed meditation. There he
made such proficiency as Leland describes, and
