future period ; and seldom wanders from his nar-

first task was the Chronicle of England‚ from the
dissolution of the Saxon government to the death
of Edward Ι. A history of the first years of the
reign of Edward II. was afterwards added; but

I. II. and III. are original, and chiefly derived
from personal knowledge and contemporary re·
port; for example, under the year 1297, while
speaking of two English canons who had escaped
out of Scotland, he says, “quorum unus mansit
apud nos per tempus aliquod, et periculum suum
