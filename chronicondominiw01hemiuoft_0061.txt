³ Battle of Tenchebray. This
battle was fought for the relies of
the important fortress of ‘renche-
bray, three leagues from Mor-
tain, which Henry had besieged.
The defeat sustained hythe Duke
was owing to the treachery of
Robert de Belesme, who deserted
with a strong division of the
army.

⁴ Duke Robert was made pri-
soner by Galdric, King Henry's
chaplain‚ who was promoted for

this service to the bishopric of
Llandaff.

⁶ Duke Robert was confined
in Cardiff Castle, and at first al-
lowed air and exercise in the
neighbouring woods; but being
taken whilst endeavouring to
make his escape, he was after-
wards more strictly guarded.
Some historiam—but these lived
in the century next ensuing—
affirm that he was deprived of
his sight by his brother’s order.
After a captivity of twenty-eight
years, he died iu Cardifl' Castis
in 1135, a few months before the
king.
