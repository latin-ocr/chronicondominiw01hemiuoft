² ‘ Lacy,' MS. cott. Tib. The
Earl of Ulster.

³ ‘Bruse,’ MS. Lansd. The
misfortunes of this nobleman, who
was a near relative of William de
Ferrers, Earl of Derby, originated
in a dispute with the King con-
cerning the payment of certain
dues, which having risen to a
great height, his wife, Matilda de
Heya, and several of his children,
were seized ,by Duncan de Car-
rick‚ at Galway, whilst endea-
vouring to escape into Scotland,
aud confined first at Bristol, and
afterwards at Windsor. William
de Braose, having obtained the

molested through the country, in
order to make up the sum of
4ο,000 marks, agreed on as the
price of his restoration to the
royal favor, took this opportunity
of escaping to the continent3 sen-
tence of outlawry was imme-
diately passed against him, and
his wife and children were in-
humanly starved to death at
Windsor. Braose himself died
shortly after at Paris, and was
honorably interred by Stephen
Langt0n‚ Archbishop of Canter-
bury, who was also an exile.
