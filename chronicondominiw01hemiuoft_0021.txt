PREFACE. XV

College Oxford, also possess portions of our Au-
thor’s History, the latter the reign of Edward
III. In C. C. C. Cambridge there is a complete

copy as sar as the year 1312 written on paper
in a late hand.

The text of the present edition is based on the Textortbe
Manuscript in the College os Arms, which has Ξὲῗῗίἷῖῐ·
always been deservedly considered as the best;
and all various readings of the Lansdown and
Cotton MSS. which could be considered as use-
ful have been given in foot-noteS.

In the Chronology of his History Heming-
burgh pursues no uniform system, but, following
the various sources of his information‚ com-
mences the year sometimes in January, some-
times in March. For the sake of convenience,
therefore, the actual date has been inserted in
the margin, according to the present division of
time; and when the date of the month on which
any particular event occurred is stated by Hem-
ingburgh, the day of the week has frequently
been calculated, and added as a side-note.
This, it is hoped, will be found useful by those
who may have need to verify the accuracy os the
date ascribed by historians to any event3 as,
while some chroniclers state the date of the
month, others inform us the day of the week on
which such event occurred, and the concordance
or disagreement of two or more authorities on

this point may in general be considered a good
test of the truth or uncertainty of such date.

It is my pleasing duty to return my sincere
thanks to Sir Charles G. Young, F. S. Α., Garter
King of Arms, and the College of Heralds‚ sor
their kindness in granting me permission to
make use os the valuable manuscript which forms
the text of this edition. My best thanks arc also
